Thanks for downloading the geospatial data products for B118. Two products included in this version 6.2 release are a zipped shapefile and a zipped geodatabase with a feature class inside.

The shapefile is compatible with many open source GIS software applications but the geodatabase (and included feature class) will only work with ESRI products.
Metadata is included with both versions of the dataset. Field names are truncated with the shapefile, please review the metadata for complete field names.
